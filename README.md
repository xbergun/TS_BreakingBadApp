# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a web application built with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, that utilizes the Breaking Bad API, which provides data about the popular television show "Breaking Bad" such as characters, episodes and quotes. The application likely allows users to view and interact with data from the Breaking Bad API in a user-friendly manner. It is also possible that the project would allow to do some operation on the data like filtering,

It also utilizes React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The use of TypeScript provides benefits such as improved code organization, stronger type checking, and a more maintainable codebase. The combination of React and TypeScript allows for efficient and robust front-end development while the Breaking Bad API provides a wealth of data for the application to use.

Overall, this project likely allows fans of the show to access and explore a wealth of information about Breaking Bad in a user-friendly and interactive way.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
